Web-Based Calculator Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This project involves the design and development of a web-based calculator application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

HTML is used to create the structure of the calculator, including the display screen and buttons. CSS is used to style the calculator, giving it a clean, modern, and visually appealing layout with proper alignment and responsiveness. JavaScript is used to implement the calculator’s functionality by handling user inputs, performing calculations, and displaying results dynamically.

The calculator processes user inputs through interactive buttons and displays real-time results on the screen. It also includes features such as clearing the display and handling invalid expressions gracefully. This project helps in understanding key front-end development concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and user interface design.

Overall, this project demonstrates the practical implementation of web technologies and serves as a beginner-friendly application for learning and practicing JavaScript logic and front-end development skills.
